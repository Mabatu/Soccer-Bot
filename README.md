This repository contains firmware for controlling a robot powered by an ESP32 and driven by four DC motors using an L298N motor driver. I am specifically using a Wemos Lolin32 Lite board due to its small size, which allows it to fit on a breadboard, and its wireless capabilities, as it has built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. This eliminates the need for additional Bluetooth or Wi-Fi modules. Additionally, it has integrated support for Li-Po and Li-Ion batteries.
